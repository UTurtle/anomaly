# DCASE 2024 Task 2: First-Shot Unsupervised Anomalous Sound Detection

## Overview

The **DCASE 2024 Task 2** focuses on developing an **unsupervised anomalous sound detection (ASD)** system for machine condition monitoring. The goal is to detect abnormal sounds using only normal operational data, ensuring the system generalizes across different domains and new machine types without requiring hyperparameter tuning. This task emphasizes domain generalization, limited training data, and adaptability to scenarios with or without additional attribute information.
