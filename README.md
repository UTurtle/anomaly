# DCASE 2024 Task 2: First-Shot Unsupervised Anomalous Sound Detection

## Overview

The **DCASE 2024 Task 2** focuses on developing an **Anomalous sound detection (ASD)** is the task of identifying whether the sound emitted from a target machine is normal or anomalous. Automatic detection of mechanical failure is an essential technology in the fourth industrial revolution, which involves artificial-intelligence-based factory automation. Prompt detection of machine anomalies by observing sounds is useful for monitoring the condition of machines. Figure 1 shows an overview of the detection system.
